# An unofficial node library for Google AdWords
Under development!

## Installing the library

```bash
npm install googleads-node-lib
```

## Authentication
The library gets credentials via environment variables which are either present or loaded via a `.env` file.  An example `.env` file is provided in `.env-example`.

## Using the library
Until some documentation is written, examples of using the library are available in the gulp tasks.
